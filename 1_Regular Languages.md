When discussing math theory in computer science we use *computational models* which represent idealized computers. Different types vary in accuracy. The [[Finite State Machine]] is the simpliest model. 
[[Nondeterminism]] is a critical concept in *deterministic computation*. We know what next input should be, etc. *Nondeterministic* machines have several generalized choices. NFAs have multiple exiting arrows when you work with state diagrams. 
[[Regular Expressions]] are built with a mix of regular math operations describing languages.
